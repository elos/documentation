Introduction
------------

This is the elos guide. I am writing this collection to clarify, elaborate and _hopefully_ enumerate the various ideas which influence elos. A small external interest in elos is emerging, and I would like to establish some key ideas and principles that have surfaced in discussion. The documents here are no bible, but rather form a simple foundation.

**A note to the contributor:** If you feel any part of these documents should be challenged, do so. If you find gramatical or syntactic mistakes, do change them. If there need to be clarifications, raise the issue. Indeed elos is _about_ sweating the particulars before you build the system to which you forfeit these decisions. There are three beliefs, at least, which should influence such dialogue.

#### 1. Elos is not new

Elos solves old problems. This is a difficult notion, at least for me, because hubris blocks such a perspective. We want to think that our time is the most advanced, favorable, and developed period in the history of humanity: not just technologically, but psychologically and spiritually. Surrending this notion is, I've found, tough. When my primary school teachers introduced me to the classical era, 2000 years seemed impossibly long. I recall thinking that the lives and experiences of people two millinea ago _must_ be a disjoint set from those that I encounter. I am now convinced, based on the writings of Aristotle and Epictecus and others, that this distinction does not exist. The trials of the human spirit are manifest today in much the same way as they have been for thousands of years.

I believe that technological advance, which I define to be the improvement of the _tools_ we use, has changed, perhaps, the scope of our ability. It has not, however, much changed our environment. In the scope of the 14 billion year old universe, on a 4 billion year old earth, the 200,000 year time scale of the homo sapien sapien should not be overestimated. I propose that Socrates is your contemporary. His thoughts have no less influence on elos because of the time at which he formulated them. Elos deals with truth in spite of time, not truth determined by time.

#### 2. Elos acknowledges struggle

I recall, at one point, imagining the range of human emotion as a spectrum between suffering and happiness. However my experience has characterized this notion as ill-founded, as too one-dimensional. Instead, I propose numbness as the antithesis to human happiness, and human suffering. 

We choose not the path of numbness, but rather the path of grit and endurance in the face of inevitable challenge, and suffering. In doing so, we claim the opportunity to work through hardship towards achievement, and happiness. We seek to improve life. But this improvement is not, as I used to concieve, the pursuit of a world absent of pain. We understand suffering as inherent to the walk of life. Suffering and pain are but two streets on the route to an understanding of truth and a respect of the nature of this world and life.

> He who learns must suffer.
> And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget
> falls drop by drop upon the heart,
> and in our own despite, against our will,
> comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.
- Aeschylus, 500 B.C.

Elos has the motto _per aspera_. This phrase translates, from latin, to "through hardship." The role of the elos engineer is to weigh and consider various potential paths. To attempt to establish, in the face of ambiguity, some primitive form of certainty. To build some foundation on which to propel human action and thought. The elos engineer shies not from the arduous nature such a task entails. Nor does she or he fail to jump at the opportunity for joy which such an achievement might bring.

#### 3. Elos is tractable

The ultimate goal of elos, is to help us, and improve us. But "improvement" has different meanings, and we must define the dimension in which we want to improve. At elos, improvement consists of continuing the millenial process uncovering and and establishing the truth we believe to exist. There will be no truly "revolutionary" idea in this space. The impulse toward "discovery for humanity," is, perhaps, conceited.

Discovery for the self, on the individual level, occurs every day. I refuse to assume that we can fix anything quick. I refuse even to assume that anything *needs* fixing. Perhaps a shift in perspective will suffice. I expect small wins. I believe these will add up over time and allow us to achieve something noticeable. The goal is small improvements everyday, and a fantastically simple goal it is.

In spite of such a simple goal, the infrastructure of elos is, and will likely continue to be, complex. Such is the nature of the man-made frameworks we erect must meet the natural biological, geological and astronomical granduer to which we are subject. I hope only to convince you that the goal is tenable, can be held in the palm of your hand and circled in your head. The understanding for why we work on elos becomes intuitive. At times, the formality introduced by the information systems we use to build elos can create a level of abstraction that obscures, but I value intuition over all else. An intuition towards small wins, over time.

------------------------

Elos is not new. Elos acknowledges suffering. Elos is tractable. Three notions that influence all dialogue. I encourage you to remember these. And to remember that you are not alone.
