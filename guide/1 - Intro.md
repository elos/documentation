Introduction
------------

This is the elos guide. I am writing this collection to clarify, elaborate and enumerate the various ideas which influence elos. A small external interest in elos is emerging, and I would like to establish some key things for those interested in learning more. Owing to that interest, and with the aim of helping the developers hoping to further the goal of elos, I will discuss and expound some of the core principles over which I have pored recently. The documents here are not bible. They do provide a reasonable foundation.

If you feel any part of these documents should be challenged, do so. If you find gramatical or syntactic mistakes, do change them. If there need to be clarifications, raise the issue. To these three treaties, I would like to add that I hope to avoid bike-shedding: needlessly arguing over small details. Indeed elos is _about_ sweating the particulars before you build the system to which you forfeit these decisions. But three axioms, at least, should influence such dialogue.

#### 1. Elos is not new.

Elos solves old problems. The foundational themes of elos must touch eternality. This is a difficult thing to realize, and hubris blocks such a perspective. We want to think that our time is the most advanced, favorable, and developed period in the history of humanity. Surrending this notion is tough. When I first learned about the classics, 2000 years seemed impossibly long. The lives and experiences of people two millinea ago _must_ be a disjoint set from those that I encounter, I thought. But alas, this is not the case.

Technological advance, which I define to be the improvement of tools used by humans, has changed, perhaps, the scope of the ability of humans. It has not, however, much changed the environment (nodding, of course, to the global emission of so-called green-house gasses, and their effect on our fragile atmosphere of ozone, as a member of the set of notable exceptions). I propose that generally speaking, the enviroment of man has not changed much. In the scope of the 14 billion year old universe, on a 4 billion year old earth, the 200,000 year time scale of the homo sapien sapien should not be overestimated. A couple of obtuse figures I employ to make the point: Socrates is your contemporary. His thoughts have no less influence on elos because of the time at which he formulated them. Elos deals with truth in spite of time, not truth determined by time.

#### 2. Elos is hard.

Elos has the motto _per aspera_. This phrase translates, from latin, to "through hardship." The role of the elos engineer is to weigh and consider various potential paths. To attempt to establish, in the face of ambiguity, certainty. To build some foundation on which to propel human action and thought. The elos engineer turns not from the arduous nature such a task entails. Nor does she or he fail to jump at the opportunity for joy which such an achievement might bring.

Often people imagine the range of human emotion and feeling as a spectrum from suffering to happiness. This notion is fallacious. The range of human emotion is not one dimensional in such a way. Rather, Elos views the true converse of human happiness and suffering as numbness. The elos engineer chooses not the path of numbness, but rather the path of grit and endurance in the face of challenge. Elos seeks to improve life. But this improvement is not, as modern society concieves, the pursuit of a world absent of pain. Elos understands suffering as an inherent component to the walk of life. Suffering and pain is necessary to the understanding of truth and respect of the nature of this universe and life.

> He who learns must suffer.
> And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget
> falls drop by drop upon the heart,
> and in our own despite, against our will,
> comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God.
- Aeschylus, 500 B.C.

#### 3. Elos is simple

The ultimate goal of elos, is to help and improve you. "Better" translates differently to different people. Though at elos, we do believe that there is an intersection of each of these domains. Using the above two notions, we can forfeit hubris in order to see the true kernel of improvement which technology can provide. A truly "revolutionary" idea in this space will be founded on a natural foundation. An impulse toward "discovery for humanity," is conceited. Discovery for the self, on the individual level, occurs every day. Don't assume that we can fix anything quick. Don't assume that anything *needs* fixing -- perhaps a shift in perspective will do. There wil be small wins. We believe these will add up over time and allow us to achieve something noticeable. The goal is small improvements everyday. Simple.

In spite of such a simple goal, the infrastructure of elos is, and will likely continue to be, complex. The man-made frameworks we erect must meet the natural biological and geological and universal granduer to which we are subject. But the goal is easy. Understanding the reason you work on elos becomes intuitive, even though it takes time to grok the system. At times, the formality introduced by the computer systems we use to build elos can create a level of abstraction that obscures, but I encourage you to value intuition over all else. Whenever working on anything for elos, small consistent wins over time should be pursued over any claims to "revolution" and "upheaval."

Elos is not new. Elos is hard. Elos is simple. Three notions I believe should influence all dialogue, even dialogue regarding my articulation of _those_ notions. I encourage you to remember these. And to remember that you are not alone.
