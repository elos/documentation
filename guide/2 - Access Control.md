Access Control
--------------

Formal systems that maintain a collection of resources need a notion of access control. This is a foundational concept in operating systems, database systems, and also organizational systems. Elos is no different, and the elos ontology (including the dynamic ontology) are governed by the Elos Access Control (EAC) model.

### Overview

#### Universe (Elos Systems)

We must first defined the environment for the implementation of the formal rules governing our system. For elos, it is our codebase. The unvierse can be thought of as the Elos System, as the rules and logic programmed by elos engineers. The services. Basically, all of the infrastructure we have set up in order to maintain this access control.

#### Entry Point (Users)

Godel postulated that no formal system can be both consistent and complete. Such is the way with the EAC. We need an entry point. There must be a notion of a "God" object, an un-ownable entity. For these entities need to act on the resources (in our case, property) which the system maintains. Whenever you have an un-contained object, who itself is not governed by the access model, you also introduce the new formal rules of the universe (our environment). First, let us formally define a user, and the properties which for the basis of such an object.

#### Interaction (Property)
