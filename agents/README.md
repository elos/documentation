Agents
------

Agents are the autonomous actors that respond to changing conditions and information for users.

Agents are elos' strongest proprietary developmental front, as the algorithms that contribute to making the most effective decisions must be developed.

Each of the agents documented here generally has a description, and also should have a pseudocode defintion.

Note fencing pseudo code in with c, is the preferred formatting.
