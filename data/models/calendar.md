Calendar
----------

A calendar is the central data structure for a user's planned, future "events." In elos, an event or appointment that has been planned for the future is known as a [fixture](fixture.md). Fixtures are arranged in [schedules](schedule.md), which are arranged in a calendar.

Elos's calendar representation keeps track of several schedules:
 - There is a base schedule - the default schedule for _every_ day
  - There are weekday schedules, for each day of the week
   - There are yearday schedules, for each day of the year

   Weekday schedules are stored:
   ``` json
       {
                   "monday": "<bson.ObjectId>"
                           }
 ```

 Yearday schedules are stored:
 ``` json
     {
                 "109": "<bson.ObjectId>",
                             "1231": "<bson.ObjectId>"
                                     }
 ```

 The canonical elos representation of a year day is calculated:

     `100 * time.MonthInteger + time.MonthDay`

     For example: December 31st is the integer 1231.

     Though the calendar model is the basic data structure, the actual calendar resolution is implemented in an agent that is acting on behalf of a user.
